# THE Chai Machine

LOL. this was all memes

On my first day moving to SF from Toronto to work @ [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so), I was warmly welcomed to their saturday hackday :)

What were we building? A chai machine -- this repo is all the logic for our micro-controllers.

TL;DR: we drilled into a fridge,, put pumps and then: a raspberry pi would put milk and spices in a pot, then start heating according to our algorithm.
